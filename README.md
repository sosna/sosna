### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been working in IT since 1999, with a focus on statistical systems since 2005. During these years, I have developed solutions that handle the **ingestion, processing, analysis and dissemination of data**. 

I strive to develop solutions that are, first of all, **correct** (no kidding ;)), **well-crafted**, **open to changes**, **standard-compliant**, **metadata-driven** and **well-tested**.

I'm the author of the [NPM sdmx-rest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sdmx-rest) and one of the maintainers of the [SDMX-REST specification](https://github.com/sdmx-twg/sdmx-rest).
